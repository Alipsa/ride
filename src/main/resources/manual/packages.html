<h2>Loading packages</h2>
<p>
Since Renjin is a JVM implementation of R, Java classloading mechanisms apply to loading packages. This means that R packages
(libraries) need to be repackaged into jar files and made available to the classloader (i.e. made part of the classpath) when
running Renjin. There are some tools in Renjin that makes that feasible. The gnur-compile goal of the renjin-maven-plugin
can compile c and fortran code into jvm bytecode making it possible to convert GNU R packages into Renjin packages. Bedatadriven
who are the creators and maintainers of Renjin have set up a job that automatically converts all packages available on CRAN and
Bioconductor into Renjin packages and make them available on the
<a href="https://nexus.bedatadriven.com/content/groups/public/">Bedatadriven Nexus</a>.</p>
<p>
    When using Ride you have three options to make a Renjin package available to the ScriptEngine so that you can load packages
    with <span class="code"><span class="keyword">library</span>(<span class="string">"yourpackage"</span>)</span>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the dependency to the pom.xml used to start Ride</li>
        <li>Use the AetherPackageLoader</li>
        <li>Create a maven project with your own pom.xml</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Add the dependency to the pom.xml used to start Ride</h3>
This is a simple thing to do. Lets say you need to read a json file. You go to the <a href="http://packages.renjin.org/">Renjin packages list</a>
and look up rjson. You will see that the dependency information for rjson is
<div class="codeblock">
    &lt;dependency&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;groupId&gt;org.renjin.cran&lt;/groupId&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;artifactId&gt;rjson&lt;/artifactId&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;version&gt;0.2.15-renjin-21&lt;/version&gt;<br/>
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
</div>
You just need to go the the dependencies section in the Ride pom.xml and add the dependency and restart Ride and you are good to go.
</p>

<h3>Use the AetherPackageLoader</h3>
Another way is to use the AetherPackageLoader. This is basically a maven aware classloader that will dynamically look for,
download and add packages to the classpath. It is very convenient to use when prototyping and truing out various packages since you
do not need to restart sessions or Ride to make a new package available. There are some downsides with it however. AetherPackageLoader
is similar to package loading in GNU R in the sense that it will download the latest version available which may or may not work with your code
so this is likely not something you want to use in production. You enable the AetherPackageLoader by going to "Tools" -&gt; "Global Options"
and changing the package loader from ClasspathPackageLoader to AetherPackageLoader.

<h3>Create a maven project with your own pom.xml</h3>
Starting Ride 1.2 you have support for maven projects in Ride. There is a project wizard that help you create a maven project
but you can easily create your ow maven project from scratch if you are familiar with maven. If you have enabled the Global Option
"Use pom classpath" Ride will parse the pom.xml and use that classpath when running your R code. You need to be aware that the way
this is done is by creating a new classloader with the Ride classloader as the parent. This means that if a dependency is already defined in Ride
this is the version that will be used regardless of what you specify in your pom. E.g. it is not possible to define another version of Renjin
in your pom and expect Ride to hinor that version when you run your R code. However Ride also support running maven directly and when you do that
only the dependencies of your pom.xml are honored so it is still possible to execute tests etc to verify that your project works without surprises
before integrating it with your application server of choice to run your code. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Alipsa/collaborative-analytics-example">
collaborative-analytics-example</a> for an example of a custom renjin package, a maven project using the package and a spring boot application using this project.

<h2 id="using_packages">Using Packages</h2>
Since the renjin gcc compiler bridge is not 100% complete there are many packages that does not work in Renjin yet.
You can get some idea of support from <a href="http://packages.renjin.org/">Renjin packages list</a> but this will
only give you a hint.<br/>

Some of the basic packages that works flawlessly from my own personal experience are listed below.<br/>
