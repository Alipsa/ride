<h4 id="running_code">Running code</h4>
    <p>Running code works more or less the same regardless if it is R or SQL code.
    If you select a certain portion of text and click the Run button or ctrl+enter the selection only will
    be executed. To execute the whole script, either have no selected code or all of the code selected (ctrl+a).
    If nothing is selected and you hit ctrl-enter the current line will be executed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ride will detect the presence of hamcrest test and enable the "Run test" button which works a bit different than
        the Run button in the sense that first the code will be executed (so that all test methods will be loaded) and then
        will run each individual test method.
    </p>
    <p>
        For SQL you first need to reference a connection (i.e. create one in the connections tab) and then pick it in the
        drop-down. You need to choose the execution type. Executing "Run select" will display the result in the Viewer tab
        whereas Run update will just execute an update (anything other than a select query e.g. insert, create, drop, update etc)
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to execute multiple update statements you should separate them with ; even though it is possible to
        run it anyway. However the result coming back from such a query depends on the database and river implementation.
        E.g. for SQL server the following code
        <div class="codeblock">
            <span class="keyword">select</span> * <span class="keyword">from</span> table1<br/>
            <span class="keyword">select</span> * <span class="keyword">from</span> table2<br/>
        </div>
        Will return results from the 1:st query only! Where as the follwing will return results from both queries:
        <div class="codeblock">
            <span class="keyword">select</span> * <span class="keyword">from</span> table1;<br/>
            <span class="keyword">select</span> * <span class="keyword">from</span> table2<br/>
        </div>
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Menu options</h3>
<h4 id="tools-global_options">Tools -> Global options</h4>
<div>
    <p>
    The AetherPackageLoader is used per default so libraries will be fetched automatically from
    bedatadriven or maven central repos. This can be modified in the Global Options menu.</p>
    <p>If you change to the ClasspathPackageLoader you should also add dependencies to the maven pom.xml
    when running Ride. The change of package loader is persistent so add any required dependency to the pom and restart Ride.</p>
    <p>In many case this is just as convenient as using AetherPackageLoader (ClasspathPackageLoader + use pom + "add build dir").
        At the very least, this is very useful when moving from development to test to make sure dependencies are correct
    prior to integration testing in embedded mode on e.g. an app server. In the Packages tab you can see
    a list of packages loaded for the session (in case you missed a library call in the script but loaded
    it from another script - the session is shared).</p>
</div>
<h4 id="tools-running_the_repl_console">Tools -> Run REPL in console</h4>
<div>
    <p>The menu option "Tools" -> "Run REPL in console" is a convenient way to to run the Renjin repl (in a new Session).
    Its main purpose is to make it possible to verify that code that does not work is not due to some quirk in Ride but
        is actually a Renjin bug i.e. to help determine bugs in Renjin.</p>
    <p>
    After you have selected the menu option you will find the repl running in the console that started Renjin.
